The difference between Collectors.toList() and Stream.toList() in Java lies in their usage, mutability, and the version of Java they were introduced in.


1> Collectors.toList()  : Mutable ->  The list returned by Collectors.toList() is typically mutable, meaning you can modify the list (add, remove, or update elements).

2> Stream.toList() :  The list returned by Stream.toList() is unmodifiable, meaning you cannot modify the list after it is created (attempting to do so will throw an UnsupportedOperationException).
