//coin <= i: Ensures the coin's value does not exceed the current amount.
//dp[i-coin] + 1: Represents using one more coin (the current coin) in addition to the minimum coins needed for the remaining amount (i-coin).
//Math.min(dp[i], dp[i-coin]+1): Chooses the smaller value between the current minimum (dp[i]) and the new possibility (dp[i-coin]+1).
//This way, for each amount, you always keep track of the least coins needed by considering all coin denominations.
