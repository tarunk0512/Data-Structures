                //         dp[i] stores total number of combinations to make amount i.

                //dp[i] = number of ways to make amount i using the coins weâ€™ve processed so far.
                //dp[i - coin] = number of ways to make the smaller amount i - coin.
                //If we already know how to make (i - coin),
                //then adding one coin to each of those ways will give us a way to make i.
